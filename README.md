## Crime analysis in R

This growing repository contains code to enable analysts to tidy, manipulate and (interactively) visualise police recorded crime data in R.

#### Preparation

Visit [data.police.uk](https://data.police.uk/data/) and download some police recorded crime data. The data will be downloaded as CSV files compressed into a zip file. Extract the CSV files into a folder on your computer. 

The data used in the example code derives from crime recorded by Greater Manchester Police between December 2014 and November 2015.

#### The code
  
* tidying data
* summary statistics
* the 80-20 rule
* repeat locations
* simple shiny apps
    - bar charts
    - time series
