## Crime analysis in R

This growing repository contains scripts that enable users to load, tidy, manipulate, summarise and (interactively) visualise police recorded crime data in R.

#### Preparation

Download R from [https://cran.r-project.org](https://cran.r-project.org), then visit [data.police.uk](https://data.police.uk/data/) to get hold of some open source police recorded crime data. The data will download as CSV files that are compressed into a zip file. Extract the CSV files into a folder on your computer. 

#### The scripts
  
* tidying data
* summary statistics
* the 80-20 rule
* repeat locations
* calculating rates of crime (forthcoming)
* point pattern analysis (forthcoming)

There are also several scripts to create simple data visualisation including Cleveland-style dotplots and calendar heatmaps.

#### Shiny apps

This repository also includes several simple [shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com) apps that allow users to interactively visualise crime data.

* bar charts
* time series
